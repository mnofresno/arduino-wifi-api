# Arduino WiFi API

## Overview

The Arduino WiFi API is a library designed to facilitate the integration of WiFi capabilities into Arduino projects. This library allows you to connect your Arduino to WiFi networks, send and receive data via HTTP requests, and manage time synchronization using the DS1307 RTC (Real-Time Clock).

## Features

- **Dynamic IP Addressing**: Automatically acquires and displays the IP address upon connection.
- **LED Indicator**: Utilizes an LED to blink the last digit of the acquired IP address, providing a visual representation of the connection status.
- **Improved API Response Time**: Optimized response times for faster interactions.
- **JSON Support**: Capable of sending and receiving JSON data with appropriate headers.
- **Configuration Flexibility**: Most configuration variables are not hardcoded, allowing for easier customization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Arduino board with WiFi capabilities (e.g., ESP8266, ESP32)
- Arduino IDE installed on your computer
- Necessary libraries included in the repository for easy deployment

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/arduino-wifi-api.git
   ```
2. Open the Arduino IDE and navigate to `Sketch` > `Include Library` > `Add .ZIP Library...` and select the cloned repository.

### Usage

1. Open the `arduino_wifi_api.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
2. Modify the configuration settings as necessary for your WiFi network and desired functionality.
3. Upload the sketch to your Arduino board.
4. Monitor the Serial output for connection status and IP address.

### Example Sketches

The repository includes example sketches demonstrating how to use the library:
- **SetTime**: Example to set the time on the DS1307 RTC.
- **ReadTest**: Example to read the current time from the DS1307 RTC.

## Changelog

### Version 1.0.0

- Renamed repository for consistency in filenames upon download.
- Reduced response times for API interactions.
- Removed hardcoded IP address; now dynamically acquires IP.
- Added LED functionality to indicate the last digit of the IP address.
- Unhardcoded several configuration variables.
- Increased WiFi baud rate for improved performance.
- Ensured the system provides time without requiring headers.
- Enabled complete JSON sending and receiving with headers.
- Adjusted libraries to work with included files in the repository.
- Added all necessary libraries for easier deployment.
- Initial commit with the version of the program.
